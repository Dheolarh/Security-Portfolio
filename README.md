# PORTFOLIO

## Overview
This repository highlights my learning path as a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst. It showcases hands-on projects I've worked on both independently and as part of a team, demonstrating practical skills in network security analysis, vulnerability assessment, incident response, and threat detection.

The projects documented here reflect real-world scenarios and industry-standard tools used in cybersecurity operations. Each project includes detailed analysis, findings, and actionable recommendations to improve security posture.

## Projects

### 1. [Network Analysis](Network%20Analysis/)
**Tools**: Wireshark  
Conducted packet-level forensic analysis of network traffic to identify FTP brute force attacks, lateral movement, C2 communication, and credential compromise. Delivered incident response report with remediation recommendations.

---

### 2. [Intrusion Detection](Intrusion%20Detection/)
**Tools**: Snort, Suricata  
Configured and deployed IDS solutions to detect malicious network activity. Created custom signatures for ICMP floods, SSH brute force attacks, and reconnaissance scans with optimized alert rules.

---

### 3. [Vulnerability Assessment](Vulnerability%20Assessment/)
**Tools**: Nessus, OpenVAS  
Performed vulnerability scanning on Metasploitable 2 and Windows 7 systems. Identified critical vulnerabilities (CVSS 10.0) including UnrealIRCd backdoor and MS11-030, with prioritized remediation strategies.

---

### 4. [Rootkit Detector](Rootkit-detector/)
**Tools**: Python, C, Linux /proc  
Developed custom security utility to detect hidden processes and LKM rootkits by comparing userland process lists against kernel-level /proc data. Includes simulation component for testing.
