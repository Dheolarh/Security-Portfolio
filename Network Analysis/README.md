# Network Analysis Project

This folder contains comprehensive documentation of network traffic analysis performed using Wireshark to detect and investigate security incidents in a controlled environment.

## Tools Used

- **Wireshark** - Industry-standard deep packet inspection and network protocol analyzer
- **Kali Linux** - Attacker machine for simulating various network attacks
- **Target Systems** - Multiple systems for comprehensive traffic analysis

## Contents

- **Analysis Report/Report.md** - Detailed analysis report documenting the investigation of network traffic, attack patterns, and security findings
- **Analysis Report/Capture 1/** - First set of packet capture screenshots and evidence
- **Analysis Report/Capture 2/** - Second set of packet capture screenshots and evidence
- **Network Packets/** - Raw PCAP files containing the analyzed network traffic

## Overview

This project demonstrates professional-grade network traffic analysis and incident investigation skills, including:
- Deep packet inspection and protocol analysis
- Detection of brute force attacks and credential compromise
- Identification of lateral movement patterns
- Multi-vector attack chain reconstruction
- Evidence collection and documentation following industry standards

The analysis uncovered a sophisticated multi-vector attack involving brute force attempts, lateral movement, and successful credential compromise, demonstrating advanced threat hunting and forensic capabilities.
