# Nessus Vulnerability Assessment

This folder contains comprehensive documentation of a professional vulnerability assessment conducted using Tenable Nessus, an industry-leading vulnerability scanner, in a controlled lab environment.

## Tools Used

- **Tenable Nessus Essentials** - Industry-standard vulnerability scanning and assessment platform
- **Ubuntu** - Scanning host system running Nessus
- **Metasploitable 2** - Intentionally vulnerable Linux target system (192.168.98.128)
- **Windows 7 Professional** - Legacy Microsoft OS target for assessment (192.168.98.129)
- **fping** - High-performance network discovery tool for identifying live hosts

## Contents

- **Report.md** - Detailed vulnerability assessment report documenting critical findings, risk analysis, and comprehensive mitigation strategies for both target systems
- **Captures/** - Screenshots and visual evidence of vulnerability identification, severity ratings, and scan results

## Overview

This project demonstrates professional-grade vulnerability assessment capabilities across multiple operating systems, identifying and documenting **critical security flaws** that would lead to immediate system compromise in a production environment.

### Key Assessment Findings:

**Metasploitable 2 (Linux) - 67 Vulnerabilities Detected:**
- UnrealIRCd backdoor (CVE-2010-2072) - **CVSS 10.0**
- VNC Server weak password authentication - **CVSS 10.0**
- SSL Version 2/3 Protocol vulnerabilities - **CVSS 9.8**
- Insecure remote access services (rlogin/rexec) - **CVSS 7.5**

**Windows 7 Professional - End-of-Life System:**
- Unsupported operating system - **CVSS 10.0**
- MS11-030: DNS Remote Code Execution - **CVSS 10.0**
- MS17-010: SMBv1 Multiple Vulnerabilities (EternalBlue) - **CVSS 8.1**

### Skills Demonstrated:

- **Vulnerability Assessment** - Professional-grade scanning and identification using Nessus
- **Risk Analysis** - CVSS-based severity rating and impact assessment
- **Technical Documentation** - Detailed vulnerability descriptions and exploitation scenarios
- **Remediation Planning** - Comprehensive mitigation strategies and phased action plans
- **Compliance & Standards** - Following industry best practices for vulnerability management

This assessment successfully identified multiple critical remote code execution vulnerabilities, EOL system risks, and insecure protocol implementations, demonstrating advanced skills in vulnerability analysis, risk assessment, and strategic remediation planning.
